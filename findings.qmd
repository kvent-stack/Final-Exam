# Overview

This project examined neighborhood-level disparities in food retail
access across Chicago’s 77 community areas, using business license
records, ACS demographics, and spatial data integration. The analysis
revealed substantial variation in both the total number of food
retailers and the per-capita accessibility of those retailers, with
clear geographic and socioeconomic patterns. These findings highlight
the extent to which food access is shaped by a combination of commercial
density, residential population characteristics, and the spatial
configuration of the city itself.

# Key Analytical Findings

**Neighborhood-Level Variation in Retail Access**

Across Chicago, food retailer availability is highly uneven, with a
small group of central-city neighborhoods dominating total store counts.
The Loop, Near North Side, and Near West Side contain several hundred
food retail establishments, far exceeding the citywide median of 89
stores. This reflects Chicago’s long-standing commercial clustering:
mixed-use downtown areas absorb an outsized share of the region’s retail
activity.

When standardized by population, these disparities persist. Per-capita
access ranges from 0 to nearly 55 stores per 10,000 residents, with half
of all communities falling below roughly 11 stores per 10,000 residents.
Central and North Side neighborhoods continue to dominate the upper
tail, while many South and Southwest Side communities exhibit
single-digit access levels.

In effect, residents in some neighborhoods have five to ten times the
retail availability experienced in others.

**High-Access and Low-Access Neighborhood Profiles**

The ten neighborhoods with the highest stores-per-capita values are
overwhelmingly located in or adjacent to the central business district.
Many combine dense concentrations of commercial property, a robust
daytime population, and comparatively smaller residential bases.

This produces extremely high per-capita ratios even when raw store
counts are moderate.

By contrast, the lowest-access neighborhoods are concentrated on the
South Side and far Northwest Side, including areas like Oakland,
Burnside, and Riverdale. These communities often pair limited commercial
corridors with larger residential populations, resulting in low-access
environments even when modest retail exists.

These disparities point to structural geographic patterns rather than
isolated anomalies.

**Distributional Inequality**

Dispersion measures reinforce these patterns. A standard deviation of
\~10 stores per 10,000 residents—nearly equal to the median—signals
substantial inequality in retail availability. The wide interquartile
range and pronounced right-skew indicate that a small number of
communities pull the distribution upward while many remain clustered at
lower-access levels.

Collectively, the descriptive results show that food retail in Chicago
is not distributed proportionally to population and that residents
experience markedly different retail environments depending on where
they live.

# Socioeconomic Drivers of Access

**Income as a Predictor of Retail Availability**

Regression modeling showed that median household income is significantly
and positively associated with per-capita retail access. Wealthier
communities tend to support more food retailers, even after controlling
for population size. This suggests that retailers preferentially locate
in areas with stronger consumer purchasing power, reinforcing the city’s
economic geography.

While the model explains roughly one-third of variation in access
(Adjusted R² ≈ 0.34), the sizable residuals indicate that income alone
does not capture the full set of forces that determine retail presence.
Zoning, land use, historical investment, and the location of commercial
corridors all likely play significant roles.

**Population Size and Commercial Concentration**

Total population also shows a positive relationship with retail access,
but its influence is more modest. Larger communities may sustain more
businesses simply because they contain more potential customers. But the
strongest concentration continues to be in areas that combine commercial
density with high-income or mixed-use land patterns.

Overall, socioeconomic conditions explain a meaningful portion of the
city’s retail landscape, but not all of it.

# Spatial Patterns and Geographic Equity

**Core–Periphery Structure**

Spatial visualizations reveal a clear core–periphery divide:

-   The central city and select North Side neighborhoods show high total
    and per-capita access.

-   Large portions of the South, Southwest, and Far Northwest Sides fall
    into the lowest-access categories.

This structure mirrors long-standing patterns in both commercial
development and public investment.

**Implications for Residents**

A resident in a lower-access neighborhood faces longer travel times for
basic goods, fewer options for affordable and healthy food, and reduced
convenience compared to residents in central corridors.

These burdens compound existing socioeconomic inequities and may
reinforce broader disparities in health, economic mobility, and
neighborhood stability.

# Policy Implications

**Strengthening Retail Availability in Underserved Areas**

Findings point to several potential strategies:

-   Targeted retail incentives in communities with low per-capita access

-   Mixed-use zoning reforms to expand commercial corridors in
    underserved neighborhoods

-   Support for small grocers and culturally specific food retailers

-   Public–private partnerships aimed at increasing local food
    availability

Such interventions should be paired with community-led planning to
ensure that investments align with resident needs.

**Integrating Transit and Retail Planning**

Because many low-access communities are also transit-limited, aligning
CTA planning with retail investment could strengthen neighborhood
resilience. Improved bus frequency, new stop placement near commercial
corridors, or micro-mobility options could meaningfully increase access
without major retail expansion.

**Equity Considerations**

The concentration of retail access in wealthier and more centrally
located neighborhoods raises questions about equitable distribution of
commercial opportunities. Policymakers should consider food access
alongside broader equity frameworks that address historical
disinvestment, land-use constraints, and neighborhood-level resource
gaps.

# Conclusions

Chicago’s food retail landscape displays striking geographic and
socioeconomic disparities that shape residents’ daily access to
essential goods. While high-access communities benefit from dense,
mixed-use commercial environments, many South and Northwest Side
neighborhoods face low per-capita availability that may impede food
security and economic mobility.

This analysis demonstrates that both income and population contribute
meaningfully to access—but do not fully explain it—suggesting that
zoning, land-use history, and commercial corridor patterns also play
critical roles. Ultimately, these findings underscore the need for
coordinated planning efforts that prioritize retail equity as part of
broader neighborhood development strategies.

# Future Directions

Future extensions of this work could include:

-   Incorporating CTA GTFS networks to assess transit-based access

-   Modeling non-linear relationships using GAM or spatial regression

-   Integrating economic data from the IRS SOI or property assessments

-   Conducting block-group–level analysis for higher spatial precision

-   Adding qualitative insights from neighborhood planning documents

Such additions would deepen the understanding of how retail access
interacts with Chicago’s built environment and socioeconomic landscape.
