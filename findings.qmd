# Overview

This analysis examined neighborhood-level disparities in food retail
access across Chicago’s 77 community areas, integrating business license
data, ACS demographic indicators, and spatial methods. The results
reveal substantial variation in both the number of food retailers and
the per-capita availability of those retailers, with patterns that
closely track Chicago’s longstanding socioeconomic geography. Together,
these findings show how commercial density, residential composition, and
neighborhood economic conditions structure residents’ day-to-day access
to food.

# Key Analytical Findings

[**Neighborhood-Level Variation in Retail Access**]{.underline}

Food retailer availability is highly uneven across Chicago. While most
communities contain between 40 and 150 stores, a small set of
central-city neighborhoods - particularly those in and around the Loop -
support several hundred retailers. The citywide median store count is
79, but the maximum exceeds 690, producing a strongly right-skewed
distribution that reflects Chicago’s concentrated commercial core.

When standardized by population, these disparities remain pronounced.
Per-capita access ranges from 0 to nearly 55 stores per 10,000
residents, with half of all neighborhoods falling below 10.7 stores per
10,000. High-access communities are primarily located in the city’s core
and select North Side corridors, while many South and Southwest Side
neighborhoods sit in the lowest-access group. In practical terms,
residents in some neighborhoods experience five to ten times the retail
availability found in others.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[**High-Access and Low-Access Neighborhood Profiles**]{.underline}

The communities with the highest per-capita retail access cluster in or
near the central business district. These areas combine dense commercial
corridors with comparatively modest residential populations, producing
high access ratios even when raw store counts are not exceptional.

By contrast, the lowest-access neighborhoods are concentrated on the
South and Far Northwest Sides. These areas typically pair limited
commercial infrastructure with larger residential bases, resulting in
modest retail availability diluted across more residents. The pattern
reflects structural geography - not isolated anomalies - and aligns with
historical development and investment trajectories across the city.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[**Distributional Inequality**]{.underline}

Measures of dispersion further underscore the extent of inequality. The
standard deviation of per-capita access is nearly equal to the median,
indicating large spread across neighborhoods. The interquartile range is
wide, and the strongly right-skewed distribution suggests that a small
number of communities lift the citywide average, while many remain
clustered at lower access levels.

Overall, food retail in Chicago is not distributed proportionally to
population. The result is a patchwork of neighborhood environments in
which retail availability - and therefore daily access to goods - varies
substantially based on residential location.

# Socioeconomic Drivers of Access

[**Income as a Predictor of Retail Availability**]{.underline}

Regression results show that median household income is a strong
predictor of per-capita retail access. Holding population constant, a
\$10,000 increase in neighborhood income corresponds to roughly 1.36
additional stores per 10,000 residents. Retailers are clearly more
likely to locate in higher-income areas, reinforcing existing economic
geographies and amplifying neighborhood-level differences in access.

The model explains about one-third of all variation (Adjusted R² ≈
0.315). This indicates that socioeconomic conditions matter - but only
partially. The remaining variation likely reflects zoning restrictions,
the placement of commercial corridors, transit accessibility, historical
development patterns, and the spatial limits of mixed-use districts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[**Population Size and Commercial Concentration**]{.underline}

While total population is also positively associated with per-capita
access, the effect is more modest. Larger communities appear able to
support additional retailers, but the most pronounced disparities stem
from commercial intensity rather than raw population. Taken together,
the results show that income and population both shape retail access,
but they do so against a backdrop of broader spatial structures that
define where retail can and does exist.

# Spatial Patterns and Geographic Equity

[**Core–Periphery Structure**]{.underline}

Spatial patterns show a clear core–periphery divide. High-income,
high-access communities cluster downtown and along the North Side, while
lower-income, low-access communities span much of the South, Southwest,
and Far Southeast Sides. Between these extremes, many North and
Northwest Side communities fall into a moderate-access, moderate-income
band - neither underserved nor highly amenitized.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[**Implications for Residents**]{.underline}

For residents of high-access neighborhoods, daily needs can be met
through dense, walkable, and varied retail environments. In contrast,
residents in lower-access communities face longer travel times, fewer
choices, reduced geographic convenience, and potential limitations in
affordability or cultural relevance. These constraints compound broader
inequities in economic mobility, health, and neighborhood stability.

# **Clustering: Retail Access and Income**

K-means clustering further confirmed that Chicago’s retail landscape is
patterned - not random. The algorithm identified three groups:

-   Cluster 1 (high income, high access) – concentrated downtown and on
    the North Side; these neighborhoods benefit from dense commercial
    environments reinforced by strong purchasing power.

-   Cluster 2 (moderate income, moderate access) – predominantly North
    and Northwest Side communities with stable, mid-tier retail
    environments.

-   Cluster 3 (low income, low access) – concentrated across the South
    and Southwest Sides; these communities face compounded economic and
    spatial barriers to retail availability.

The clusters show that socioeconomic conditions and retail presence are
tightly intertwined, reflecting structural inequities rather than
isolated or idiosyncratic outcomes.

# Policy Implications

[**Strengthening Retail Availability in Underserved Areas**]{.underline}

Findings point to several potential strategies:

-   Targeted retail incentives in communities with low per-capita access

-   Mixed-use zoning reforms to expand commercial corridors in
    underserved neighborhoods

-   Support for small grocers and culturally specific food retailers

-   Public–private partnerships aimed at increasing local food
    availability

Such interventions should be paired with community-led planning to
ensure that investments align with resident needs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[**Integrating Transit and Retail Planning**]{.underline}

Because many low-access communities are also transit-limited, aligning
CTA planning with retail investment could strengthen neighborhood
resilience. Improved bus frequency, new stop placement near commercial
corridors, or micro-mobility options could meaningfully increase access
without major retail expansion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[**Equity Considerations**]{.underline}

The concentration of retail access in wealthier and more centrally
located neighborhoods raises questions about equitable distribution of
commercial opportunities. Policymakers should consider food access
alongside broader equity frameworks that address historical
disinvestment, land-use constraints, and neighborhood-level resource
gaps.

# Conclusions

Chicago’s food retail landscape displays striking geographic and
socioeconomic disparities that shape residents’ daily access to
essential goods. While high-access communities benefit from dense,
mixed-use commercial environments, many South and Northwest Side
neighborhoods face low per-capita availability that may impede food
security and economic mobility.

This analysis demonstrates that both income and population contribute
meaningfully to access - but do not fully explain it - suggesting that
zoning, land-use history, and commercial corridor patterns also play
critical roles. Ultimately, these findings underscore the need for
coordinated planning efforts that prioritize retail equity as part of
broader neighborhood development strategies.

# Future Directions

Future extensions of this work could include:

-   Incorporating CTA GTFS networks to assess transit-based access

-   Modeling non-linear relationships using GAM or spatial regression

-   Integrating economic data from the IRS SOI or property assessments

-   Conducting block-group–level analysis for higher spatial precision

-   Adding qualitative insights from neighborhood planning documents

Such additions would deepen the understanding of how retail access
interacts with Chicago’s built environment and socioeconomic landscape.
