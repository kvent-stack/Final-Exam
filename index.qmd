Chicago’s retail landscape varies dramatically by neighborhood. This project links city business-license data, community-area boundaries, and ACS population estimates to evaluate how equitably food retailers are distributed - and whether socioeconomic conditions help explain the disparities.

This site summarizes that work, providing a reproducible analysis pipeline, exploratory data visualizations, and key findings on neighborhood equity and food access.
