# Retail Access & Neighborhood Equity in Chicago

Neighborhood access to food retailers is deeply uneven across Chicago, with some communities surrounded by commercial corridors and others facing low-density retail environments that limit everyday options. This project measures these disparities by combining business license data, ACS population estimates, and spatial analysis to examine how food retail access varies across the city’s 77 community areas — and how those patterns align with socioeconomic and geographic structures.

This site summarizes that work, providing a reproducible analysis pipeline, exploratory data visualizations, and key findings on neighborhood equity and food access.
