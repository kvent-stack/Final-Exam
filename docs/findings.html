<section id="overview" class="level1" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Overview</h1>
<p>This analysis examined neighborhood-level disparities in food retail access across Chicago’s 77 community areas, integrating business license data, ACS demographic indicators, and spatial methods. The results reveal substantial variation in both the number of food retailers and the per-capita availability of those retailers, with patterns that closely track Chicago’s longstanding socioeconomic geography. Together, these findings show how commercial density, residential composition, and neighborhood economic conditions structure residents’ day-to-day access to food.</p>
</section>
<section id="key-analytical-findings" class="level1" data-number="2">
<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Key Analytical Findings</h1>
<p><u><strong>Neighborhood-Level Variation in Retail Access</strong></u></p>
<p>Food retailer availability is highly uneven across Chicago. While most communities contain between 40 and 150 stores, a small set of central-city neighborhoods - particularly those in and around the Loop - support several hundred retailers. The citywide median store count is 79, but the maximum exceeds 690, producing a strongly right-skewed distribution that reflects Chicago’s concentrated commercial core.</p>
<p>When standardized by population, these disparities remain pronounced. Per-capita access ranges from 0 to nearly 55 stores per 10,000 residents, with half of all neighborhoods falling below 10.7 stores per 10,000. High-access communities are primarily located in the city’s core and select North Side corridors, while many South and Southwest Side neighborhoods sit in the lowest-access group. In practical terms, residents in some neighborhoods experience five to ten times the retail availability found in others.</p>
<hr>
<p><u><strong>High-Access and Low-Access Neighborhood Profiles</strong></u></p>
<p>The communities with the highest per-capita retail access cluster in or near the central business district. These areas combine dense commercial corridors with comparatively modest residential populations, producing high access ratios even when raw store counts are not exceptional.</p>
<p>By contrast, the lowest-access neighborhoods are concentrated on the South and Far Northwest Sides. These areas typically pair limited commercial infrastructure with larger residential bases, resulting in modest retail availability diluted across more residents. The pattern reflects structural geography - not isolated anomalies - and aligns with historical development and investment trajectories across the city.</p>
<hr>
<p><u><strong>Distributional Inequality</strong></u></p>
<p>Measures of dispersion further underscore the extent of inequality. The standard deviation of per-capita access is nearly equal to the median, indicating large spread across neighborhoods. The interquartile range is wide, and the strongly right-skewed distribution suggests that a small number of communities lift the citywide average, while many remain clustered at lower access levels.</p>
<p>Overall, food retail in Chicago is not distributed proportionally to population. The result is a patchwork of neighborhood environments in which retail availability - and therefore daily access to goods - varies substantially based on residential location.</p>
</section>
<section id="socioeconomic-drivers-of-access" class="level1" data-number="3">
<h1 data-number="3"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Socioeconomic Drivers of Access</h1>
<p><u><strong>Income as a Predictor of Retail Availability</strong></u></p>
<p>Regression results show that median household income is a strong predictor of per-capita retail access. Holding population constant, a $10,000 increase in neighborhood income corresponds to roughly 1.36 additional stores per 10,000 residents. Retailers are clearly more likely to locate in higher-income areas, reinforcing existing economic geographies and amplifying neighborhood-level differences in access.</p>
<p>The model explains about one-third of all variation (Adjusted R² ≈ 0.315). This indicates that socioeconomic conditions matter - but only partially. The remaining variation likely reflects zoning restrictions, the placement of commercial corridors, transit accessibility, historical development patterns, and the spatial limits of mixed-use districts.</p>
<hr>
<p><u><strong>Population Size and Commercial Concentration</strong></u></p>
<p>While total population is also positively associated with per-capita access, the effect is more modest. Larger communities appear able to support additional retailers, but the most pronounced disparities stem from commercial intensity rather than raw population. Taken together, the results show that income and population both shape retail access, but they do so against a backdrop of broader spatial structures that define where retail can and does exist.</p>
</section>
<section id="spatial-patterns-and-geographic-equity" class="level1" data-number="4">
<h1 data-number="4"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Spatial Patterns and Geographic Equity</h1>
<p><u><strong>Core–Periphery Structure</strong></u></p>
<p>Spatial patterns show a clear core-periphery divide. High-income, high-access communities cluster downtown and along the North Side, while lower-income, low-access communities span much of the South, Southwest, and Far Southeast Sides. Between these extremes, many North and Northwest Side communities fall into a moderate-access, moderate-income band - neither underserved nor highly amenitized.</p>
<hr>
<p><u><strong>Implications for Residents</strong></u></p>
<p>For residents of high-access neighborhoods, daily needs can be met through dense, walkable, and varied retail environments. In contrast, residents in lower-access communities face longer travel times, fewer choices, reduced geographic convenience, and potential limitations in affordability or cultural relevance. These constraints compound broader inequities in economic mobility, health, and neighborhood stability.</p>
</section>
<section id="clustering-retail-access-and-income" class="level1" data-number="5">
<h1 data-number="5"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> <strong>Clustering: Retail Access and Income</strong></h1>
<p>K-means clustering further confirmed that Chicago’s retail landscape is patterned - not random. The algorithm identified three groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cluster 1 (high income, high access) – concentrated downtown and on the North Side; these neighborhoods benefit from dense commercial environments reinforced by strong purchasing power.</p></li>
<li><p>Cluster 2 (moderate income, moderate access) – predominantly North and Northwest Side communities with stable, mid-tier retail environments.</p></li>
<li><p>Cluster 3 (low income, low access) – concentrated across the South and Southwest Sides; these communities face compounded economic and spatial barriers to retail availability.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The clusters show that socioeconomic conditions and retail presence are tightly intertwined, reflecting structural inequities rather than isolated or idiosyncratic outcomes.</p>
</section>
<section id="policy-implications" class="level1" data-number="6">
<h1 data-number="6"><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Policy Implications</h1>
<p><u><strong>Strengthening Retail Availability in Underserved Areas</strong></u></p>
<p>Findings point to several potential strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Targeted retail incentives in communities with low per-capita access</p></li>
<li><p>Mixed-use zoning reforms to expand commercial corridors in underserved neighborhoods</p></li>
<li><p>Support for small grocers and culturally specific food retailers</p></li>
<li><p>Public–private partnerships aimed at increasing local food availability</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Such interventions could be paired with community-led planning to ensure that investments align with resident needs.</p>
<hr>
<p><u><strong>Integrating Transit and Retail Planning</strong></u></p>
<p>Because many low-access communities are also transit-limited, aligning CTA planning with retail investment could strengthen neighborhood resilience. Improved bus frequency, new stop placement near commercial corridors, or micro-mobility options could meaningfully increase access without major retail expansion.</p>
</section>
<section id="equity-considerations" class="level1" data-number="7">
<h1 data-number="7"><span class="header-section-number">7</span> <strong>Equity Considerations</strong></h1>
<p><u><strong>Data Biases</strong></u></p>
<p>While this analysis highlights meaningful disparities in retail access across Chicago, it is equally important to recognize the limitations and potential biases embedded in the underlying data sources. The business-license dataset captures only establishments registered with the City of Chicago, which may omit informal retailers, unlicensed vendors, or small grocers that operate under broader business classifications. These omissions can disproportionately affect lower-income or immigrant neighborhoods where informal food economies are more common, leading to an undercount of available retail options and potentially overstating access inequities.</p>
<p>The ACS population estimates introduce another layer of uncertainty. Tract-level data are modeled rather than directly measured, and sampling error tends to be highest in communities with large renter populations, limited census engagement, or significant racial and economic segregation. As a result, per-capita metrics may unintentionally magnify or suppress disparities depending on the direction of local estimation error.</p>
<hr>
<p><u><strong>Responsible Policy Interpretation</strong></u></p>
<p>These limitations matter for decision-making. If policymakers rely solely on formal datasets, they risk reinforcing existing inequities by directing resources toward neighborhoods that appear most underserved on paper - even when informal or culturally specific food networks play a significant role in local economies. Conversely, neighborhoods with strong retail investment but rapid population growth may appear artificially well-resourced, masking emerging gaps in access.</p>
<p>To ethically present these findings to policymakers, I would emphasize three commitments: transparency about data limits, caution against overgeneralization and framing the analysis as a diagnostic tool, not an absolute ranking. Together, these considerations ensure that the analysis supports equitable policymaking rather than unintentionally reinforcing the structural biases embedded in Chicago’s data ecosystem.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusions" class="level1" data-number="8">
<h1 data-number="8"><span class="header-section-number">8</span> Conclusions</h1>
<p>Chicago’s food retail landscape displays striking geographic and socioeconomic disparities that shape residents’ daily access to essential goods. While high-access communities benefit from dense, mixed-use commercial environments, many South and Northwest Side neighborhoods face low per-capita availability that may impede food security and economic mobility.</p>
<p>This analysis demonstrates that both income and population contribute meaningfully to access - but do not fully explain it - suggesting that zoning, land-use history, and commercial corridor patterns also play critical roles. Ultimately, these findings underscore the need for coordinated planning efforts that prioritize retail equity as part of broader neighborhood development strategies.</p>
</section>
<section id="future-directions" class="level1" data-number="9">
<h1 data-number="9"><span class="header-section-number">9</span> Future Directions</h1>
<p>Future extensions of this work could include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Incorporating CTA GTFS networks to assess transit-based access</p></li>
<li><p>Modeling non-linear relationships using GAM or spatial regression</p></li>
<li><p>Integrating economic data from the IRS SOI or property assessments</p></li>
<li><p>Conducting block-group–level analysis for higher spatial precision</p></li>
<li><p>Adding qualitative insights from neighborhood planning documents</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Such additions would deepen the understanding of how retail access interacts with Chicago’s built environment and socioeconomic landscape.</p>
