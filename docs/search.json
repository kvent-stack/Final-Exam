    "text": "1 Overview\nThis analysis examined neighborhood-level disparities in food retail access across Chicago’s 77 community areas, integrating business license data, ACS demographic indicators, and spatial methods. The results reveal substantial variation in both the number of food retailers and the per-capita availability of those retailers, with patterns that closely track Chicago’s longstanding socioeconomic geography. Together, these findings show how commercial density, residential composition, and neighborhood economic conditions structure residents’ day-to-day access to food.\n\n\n2 Key Analytical Findings\nNeighborhood-Level Variation in Retail Access\nFood retailer availability is highly uneven across Chicago. While most communities contain between 40 and 150 stores, a small set of central-city neighborhoods - particularly those in and around the Loop - support several hundred retailers. The citywide median store count is 79, but the maximum exceeds 690, producing a strongly right-skewed distribution that reflects Chicago’s concentrated commercial core.\nWhen standardized by population, these disparities remain pronounced. Per-capita access ranges from 0 to nearly 55 stores per 10,000 residents, with half of all neighborhoods falling below 10.7 stores per 10,000. High-access communities are primarily located in the city’s core and select North Side corridors, while many South and Southwest Side neighborhoods sit in the lowest-access group. In practical terms, residents in some neighborhoods experience five to ten times the retail availability found in others.\n\nHigh-Access and Low-Access Neighborhood Profiles\nThe communities with the highest per-capita retail access cluster in or near the central business district. These areas combine dense commercial corridors with comparatively modest residential populations, producing high access ratios even when raw store counts are not exceptional.\nBy contrast, the lowest-access neighborhoods are concentrated on the South and Far Northwest Sides. These areas typically pair limited commercial infrastructure with larger residential bases, resulting in modest retail availability diluted across more residents. The pattern reflects structural geography - not isolated anomalies - and aligns with historical development and investment trajectories across the city.\n\nDistributional Inequality\nMeasures of dispersion further underscore the extent of inequality. The standard deviation of per-capita access is nearly equal to the median, indicating large spread across neighborhoods. The interquartile range is wide, and the strongly right-skewed distribution suggests that a small number of communities lift the citywide average, while many remain clustered at lower access levels.\nOverall, food retail in Chicago is not distributed proportionally to population. The result is a patchwork of neighborhood environments in which retail availability - and therefore daily access to goods - varies substantially based on residential location.\n\n\n3 Socioeconomic Drivers of Access\nIncome as a Predictor of Retail Availability\nRegression results show that median household income is a strong predictor of per-capita retail access. Holding population constant, a $10,000 increase in neighborhood income corresponds to roughly 1.36 additional stores per 10,000 residents. Retailers are clearly more likely to locate in higher-income areas, reinforcing existing economic geographies and amplifying neighborhood-level differences in access.\nThe model explains about one-third of all variation (Adjusted R² ≈ 0.315). This indicates that socioeconomic conditions matter - but only partially. The remaining variation likely reflects zoning restrictions, the placement of commercial corridors, transit accessibility, historical development patterns, and the spatial limits of mixed-use districts.\n\nPopulation Size and Commercial Concentration\nWhile total population is also positively associated with per-capita access, the effect is more modest. Larger communities appear able to support additional retailers, but the most pronounced disparities stem from commercial intensity rather than raw population. Taken together, the results show that income and population both shape retail access, but they do so against a backdrop of broader spatial structures that define where retail can and does exist.\n\n\n4 Spatial Patterns and Geographic Equity\nCore–Periphery Structure\nSpatial patterns show a clear core–periphery divide. High-income, high-access communities cluster downtown and along the North Side, while lower-income, low-access communities span much of the South, Southwest, and Far Southeast Sides. Between these extremes, many North and Northwest Side communities fall into a moderate-access, moderate-income band - neither underserved nor highly amenitized.\n\nImplications for Residents\nFor residents of high-access neighborhoods, daily needs can be met through dense, walkable, and varied retail environments. In contrast, residents in lower-access communities face longer travel times, fewer choices, reduced geographic convenience, and potential limitations in affordability or cultural relevance. These constraints compound broader inequities in economic mobility, health, and neighborhood stability.\n\n\n5 Clustering: Retail Access and Income\nK-means clustering further confirmed that Chicago’s retail landscape is patterned - not random. The algorithm identified three groups:\n\nCluster 1 (high income, high access) – concentrated downtown and on the North Side; these neighborhoods benefit from dense commercial environments reinforced by strong purchasing power.\nCluster 2 (moderate income, moderate access) – predominantly North and Northwest Side communities with stable, mid-tier retail environments.\nCluster 3 (low income, low access) – concentrated across the South and Southwest Sides; these communities face compounded economic and spatial barriers to retail availability.\n\nThe clusters show that socioeconomic conditions and retail presence are tightly intertwined, reflecting structural inequities rather than isolated or idiosyncratic outcomes.\n\n\n6 Policy Implications\nStrengthening Retail Availability in Underserved Areas\nFindings point to several potential strategies:\n\nTargeted retail incentives in communities with low per-capita access\nMixed-use zoning reforms to expand commercial corridors in underserved neighborhoods\nSupport for small grocers and culturally specific food retailers\nPublic–private partnerships aimed at increasing local food availability\n\nSuch interventions should be paired with community-led planning to ensure that investments align with resident needs.\n\nIntegrating Transit and Retail Planning\nBecause many low-access communities are also transit-limited, aligning CTA planning with retail investment could strengthen neighborhood resilience. Improved bus frequency, new stop placement near commercial corridors, or micro-mobility options could meaningfully increase access without major retail expansion.\n\nEquity Considerations\nThe concentration of retail access in wealthier and more centrally located neighborhoods raises questions about equitable distribution of commercial opportunities. Policymakers should consider food access alongside broader equity frameworks that address historical disinvestment, land-use constraints, and neighborhood-level resource gaps.\n\n\n7 Conclusions\nChicago’s food retail landscape displays striking geographic and socioeconomic disparities that shape residents’ daily access to essential goods. While high-access communities benefit from dense, mixed-use commercial environments, many South and Northwest Side neighborhoods face low per-capita availability that may impede food security and economic mobility.\nThis analysis demonstrates that both income and population contribute meaningfully to access - but do not fully explain it - suggesting that zoning, land-use history, and commercial corridor patterns also play critical roles. Ultimately, these findings underscore the need for coordinated planning efforts that prioritize retail equity as part of broader neighborhood development strategies.\n\n\n8 Future Directions\nFuture extensions of this work could include:\n\nIncorporating CTA GTFS networks to assess transit-based access\nModeling non-linear relationships using GAM or spatial regression\nIntegrating economic data from the IRS SOI or property assessments\nConducting block-group–level analysis for higher spatial precision\nAdding qualitative insights from neighborhood planning documents\n\nSuch additions would deepen the understanding of how retail access interacts with Chicago’s built environment and socioeconomic landscape."

administrative timestamp fields rather than in coordinates or licensing descriptors. Because the core spatial and classification variables are intact, the dataset is suitable for retailer identification and spatial assignment.\n\nNext, I standardized coordinate systems for spatial alignment and assigned each food retailer to a community area through a point-in-polygon spatial join. I then aggregated food retail counts by community and checked for representation across all 77 areas.\n\ngrocery = st_transform(grocery, st_crs(chi_comm))\n\ngrocery_joined = st_join(grocery, chi_comm, join = st_within) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(community))\n\nstore_counts = grocery_joined %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%\n  count(community, name = \"store_count\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(community = recode(community, \"OHARE\" = \"O'HARE\"))\n\nsummary(store_counts$store_count)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

These were removed prior to aggregation to avoid artificially inflating totals or creating an unintended “78th” category.\n\nTo finalize the analytic dataset, I merged community polygons, aggregated population totals, and food retail counts into a single spatial dataframe, then computed a standardized measure of food access: stores per 10,000 residents.\n\nchi_final = chi_comm %&gt;%\n  left_join(store_counts, by = \"community\") %&gt;%\n  left_join(comm_pop, by = \"community\") %&gt;%\n  replace_na(list(store_count = 0)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(stores_per_10k = (store_count / total_population) * 10000)\n\nsaveRDS(chi_final, \"data/chi_final.rds\")\n\nsummary(chi_final$stores_per_10k)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

The accessibility distribution ranges from 0 stores per 10,000 residents in the lowest-access community to approximately 55 per 10,000 residents in the highest, with a median around 10.7. This spread indicates substantial neighborhood variation in food retail density and confirms that the dataset is well-structured and ready for summary statistics, visualization, and regression modeling."

    "text": "1 Data Analysis\nTo understand how retail availability varies across the city, I first summarized the distribution of food retailers by community area. Raw store counts reveal how food retailers cluster spatially before accounting for population differences.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(tigris)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(arrow)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(purrr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(leaflet)\nlibrary(tidycensus)\n\noptions(tigris_show_progress = FALSE)\n\nchi_final = readRDS(\"data/chi_final.rds\")\n\nsummary(chi_final$store_count)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

Max. \n    0.0    43.0    79.0   130.6   159.0   691.0 \n\n\nAnalytic Interpretation: Store availability varies substantially across Chicago’s community areas, with half of neighborhoods having 79 or fewer food retailers and a small number of high-density commercial districts pulling the average upward. The gap between the median (79) and the maximum (691) illustrates a heavily right-skewed distribution, indicating that retail activity is concentrated in a handful of commercial cores rather than evenly distributed across the city.\n\nBecause raw store counts do not account for neighborhood population differences, I examined a standardized measure of access: the number of stores per 10,000 residents.\n\nsummary(chi_final$stores_per_10k)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

Max. \n  0.000   8.069  10.740  14.477  18.985  54.777 \n\n\nAnalytic Interpretation: Per-capita access to food retailers varies widely across Chicago, with half of communities having fewer than 10.7 stores per 10,000 residents and a long upper tail of neighborhoods with much higher access. The large spread between the median (10.74) and the maximum (54.77) underscores substantial inequality in retail availability when population is taken into account.\n\nTo identify neighborhoods with unusually high concentrations of food retailers, I listed the ten communities with the highest number of stores per 10,000 residents.\n\nchi_final %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(stores_per_10k)) %&gt;%\n  select(community, store_count, total_population, stores_per_10k) %&gt;%\n  slice_head(n = 10)\n\n         community store_count total_population stores_per_10k\n1             LOOP         604           110265       54.77713\n2  NEAR NORTH SIDE         691           149521       46.21424\n3   NEAR WEST SIDE         563           145209       38.77170\n4    ARMOUR SQUARE         134            35297       37.96357\n5        WEST TOWN         559           151361       36.93157\n6        LAKE VIEW         496           160164       30.96826\n7     LINCOLN PARK         389           128084       30.37069\n8  LOWER WEST SIDE         207            79992       25.87759\n9     LOGAN SQUARE         344           139058       24.73788\n10  ARCHER HEIGHTS          90            37106       24.25484\n\n\nAnalytic Interpretation: Chicago’s highest per-capita retail access is concentrated in and around the central city, with the Loop, Near North Side, and Near West Side far outpacing all other neighborhoods. These areas combine dense commercial corridors with relatively modest residential populations, producing extremely high ratios of stores per 10,000 residents compared to the rest of the city.\n\nTo identify neighborhoods that may be underserved, I listed the ten communities with the lowest number of stores per 10,000 residents.\n\nchi_final %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%\n  arrange(stores_per_10k) %&gt;%\n  select(community, store_count, total_population, stores_per_10k) %&gt;%\n  slice_head(n = 10)\n\n         community store_count total_population stores_per_10k\n1            OHARE           0            88549      0.0000000\n2          OAKLAND           1            26032      0.3841426\n3         BURNSIDE           3            21654      1.3854253\n4        RIVERDALE           8            36151      2.2129402\n5      FOREST GLEN          42            78680      5.3380783\n6        MONTCLARE          24            41953      5.7206874\n7  MOUNT GREENWOOD          36            61502      5.8534682\n8      EDISON PARK          32            52337      6.1142213\n9  CALUMET HEIGHTS          28            44391      6.3075849\n10        CLEARING          54            81856      6.5969507\n\n\nAnalytic Interpretation: The neighborhoods with the lowest per-capita retail access are primarily located on the South and far Northwest sides, with several areas-such as Oakland, Burnside, and Riverdale-showing extremely limited availability relative to their population size. These values, many under 8 stores per 10,000 residents, highlight substantial geographic inequities in Chicago’s retail landscape and point to potential gaps in neighborhood-serving commercial infrastructure.\n\nTo assess how unevenly food retail access is distributed across Chicago, I calculated simple dispersion measures (variance, standard deviation, and IQR) for stores per 10,000 residents.\n\nc(\n  variance = var(chi_final$stores_per_10k, na.rm = TRUE),\n  sd       = sd(chi_final$stores_per_10k, na.rm = TRUE),\n  iqr      = IQR(chi_final$stores_per_10k, na.rm = TRUE)\n)\n\n variance        sd       iqr \n102.06746  10.10284  10.91589 \n\n\nAnalytic Interpretation: Retail access shows substantial dispersion across Chicago’s neighborhoods, with a standard deviation of roughly 10 stores per 10,000 residents-nearly as large as the median itself. The high variance and wide interquartile range (IQR ≈ 10.9) reinforce that retail access is unevenly distributed, with significant gaps between the least- and best-served communities.\n\nTo evaluate whether socioeconomic conditions help explain disparities in per-capita retail access, I incorporated median household income from the 2022 ACS, aggregated it to community areas, merged it into the analytical dataset, and estimated a linear regression predicting stores per 10,000 residents from income and population size.\n\nlibrary(tigris)\noptions(tigris_use_cache = TRUE)\n\ntracts_cc = tracts(state = \"IL\", county = \"Cook\", year = 2022, cb = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  st_as_sf() %&gt;%\n  clean_names()\n\nacs_income = get_acs(\n  geography = \"tract\",\n  variables = \"B19013_001\",\n  state = \"IL\",\n  county = \"Cook\",\n  year = 2022,\n  geometry = FALSE\n) %&gt;%\n  clean_names() %&gt;%\n  transmute(geoid, median_income = estimate)\n\ntracts_income = tracts_cc %&gt;%\n  left_join(acs_income, by = \"geoid\")\n\ncommunity_geom = chi_final %&gt;%\n  select(community, geometry) %&gt;%\n  mutate(community = toupper(community))\n\ntracts_income = st_transform(tracts_income, st_crs(community_geom))\n\ntract_income_join = st_intersection(tracts_income, community_geom)\n\ncomm_income = tract_income_join %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%\n  group_by(community) %&gt;%\n  summarise(median_income = mean(median_income, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nchi_final = chi_final %&gt;%\n  mutate(community = toupper(community)) %&gt;%\n  left_join(comm_income, by = \"community\")\n\nchi_final = chi_final %&gt;%\n  mutate(median_income = median_income) %&gt;%\n  select(-matches(\"median_income\\\\.x|median_income\\\\.y\"))\n\nmodel = lm(stores_per_10k ~ median_income + total_population, data = chi_final)\nsummary(model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = stores_per_10k ~ median_income + total_population, \n    data = chi_final)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-16.9230  -4.8953  -0.6614   3.2486  28.6762 \n\nCoefficients:\n                   Estimate Std.

The income coefficient suggests that for every $10,000 increase in median household income, neighborhoods tend to have roughly 1.36 more stores per 10,000 residents, holding population constant-evidence that commercial activity disproportionately concentrates in higher-income parts of the city. Total population also shows a positive association: larger communities support slightly higher densities of food retailers even after adjusting for population, likely reflecting broader business viability and customer-base effects. Overall, the model explains about 33% of the variation in retail access (Adjusted R² = 0.315), meaning socioeconomic conditions play a meaningful but incomplete role in structuring Chicago’s retail landscape. The remaining unexplained variance points to additional drivers-such as zoning policies, transit access, corridor-level commercial clustering, and historical investment patterns-that likely contribute to persistent geographic disparities.\n\n\n2 Data Visualizations\nTo assess whether the linear model meets key assumptions, I generated standard diagnostic plots, including residuals vs. fitted values, a Q–Q plot, and leverage checks.\n\npar(mfrow = c(2,2))\nplot(model)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npar(mfrow = c(1,1))\n\nAnalytic Interpretation: The diagnostic plots indicate that the linear model fits reasonably well but shows a few mild assumption issues. The residuals-vs-fitted and scale-location plots show slight curvature and modest heteroskedasticity, suggesting that the relationship between income, population, and retail access is not perfectly linear across all neighborhoods. The Q–Q plot shows right-tail deviation, driven by a handful of communities with unusually high per-capita retail access. The residuals-vs-leverage plot identifies a few moderately influential areas, but none with leverage or Cook’s distance large enough to threaten model stability. Overall, the model is statistically sound for exploratory purposes, though more flexible specifications-such as nonlinear terms or robust regression-could better capture the uneven distribution of retail access across Chicago.\n\nThis plot illustrates how food retailer counts vary across Chicago’s 77 community areas.\n\nggplot(chi_final, aes(x = store_count)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = \"#2C7FB8\", color = \"white\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title=\"Distribution of Store Counts\", x=\"Store Count\", y=\"Communities\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalytic Interpretation: The distribution of store counts is strongly right-skewed. Most Chicago communities fall in the 40–150 store range, while a small number of central, high-density commercial districts contain 200–700 stores, pulling the mean upward. The long right tail reflects Chicago’s spatially concentrated retail landscape: a handful of core neighborhoods absorb a disproportionate share of food retailers, while the majority of communities have far more modest commercial footprints.\n\nThis plot shows the distribution of stores per 10,000 residents, highlighting how standardized access differs across neighborhoods.\n\nggplot(chi_final, aes(x = stores_per_10k)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = \"#41B6C4\", color=\"white\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title=\"Distribution of Stores per 10k Residents\",\n       x=\"Stores per 10k\", y=\"Communities\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalytic Interpretation: Standardizing by population produces a distribution that remains strongly right-skewed. Most communities cluster between 8 and 20 stores per 10,000 residents, while a small number of outliers reach 30–55 stores per 10,000. These high-access neighborhoods-typically centrally located with dense commercial corridors and smaller residential bases-stretch the right tail of the distribution. The pattern underscores how per-capita access is shaped not only by raw store counts but also by uneven population density, amplifying disparities between Chicago’s commercial core and its outlying communities.\n\nThis map displays the geographic distribution of total food retailer counts across Chicago.\n\nggplot(chi_final) +\n  geom_sf(aes(fill = store_count), color=\"white\", size=0.2) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c() +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalytic Interpretation: Total retailer counts are overwhelmingly concentrated in Chicago’s central corridors - especially the Loop, Near North Side, and Near West Side - where dense commercial zoning and high foot traffic support several hundred stores per community. As the map moves outward, store counts drop sharply, with most outlying neighborhoods showing far lower totals. This stark spatial gradient highlights how Chicago’s retail landscape is structured around a small core of high-density commercial districts, leaving much of the city with comparatively limited brick-and-mortar food retail presence.\n\nThis map highlights disparities in standardized retail access by showing stores per 10,000 residents.\n\nggplot(chi_final) +\n  geom_sf(aes(fill = stores_per_10k), color=\"white\", size=0.2) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(option=\"magma\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalytic Interpretation: When adjusted for population, per-capita access remains concentrated in the city’s core and along select North Side corridors, while large portions of the South and Southwest Sides exhibit noticeably lower access. This pattern suggests that both commercial density and residential composition jointly shape neighborhood-level availability of food retailers, amplifying geographic disparities in access.\n\nTo complement the static visualizations, I created an interactive map that allows users to explore individual retailer locations and their distribution across Chicago.\n\ngrocery = st_read(\n  \"https://data.cityofchicago.org/resource/xqx5-8hwx.geojson?$limit=50000\",\n  quiet = TRUE\n)\n\ngrocery_map = grocery %&gt;%\n  st_transform(st_crs(chi_final)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    lon = st_coordinates(geometry)[,1],\n    lat = st_coordinates(geometry)[,2]\n  )\n\nleaflet(grocery_map) %&gt;%\n  addTiles() %&gt;%\n  addCircleMarkers(\n    lng = ~lon, lat = ~lat,\n    radius = 2, stroke = FALSE, fillOpacity = 0.6\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning method that groups observations into distinct clusters based on their similarity. Here, I use it to identify whether Chicago’s community areas naturally sort into meaningful categories based on per-capita retail access and median household income, revealing whether structural patterns exist beyond simple linear relationships.\n\ncluster_data = chi_final %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%\n  select(community, stores_per_10k, median_income) %&gt;%\n  drop_na()\n\ncluster_scaled = cluster_data %&gt;%\n  select(stores_per_10k, median_income) %&gt;%\n  scale()\n\nset.seed(123)\nk3 = kmeans(cluster_scaled, centers = 3, nstart = 25)\n\ncluster_data$cluster = factor(k3$cluster)\n\nchi_final = chi_final %&gt;%\n  left_join(cluster_data %&gt;% select(community, cluster), by = \"community\")\n\nggplot(chi_final) +\n  geom_sf(aes(fill = cluster), color = \"white\", size = 0.2) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Clusters of Chicago Communities by Retail Access & Income\",\n    fill = \"Cluster\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nk3$centers\n\n  stores_per_10k median_income\n1      2.0913137     1.7721685\n2     -0.1319613     0.3507877\n3     -0.4303994    -0.8553662\n\n\nAnalytic Interpretation: The k-means algorithm groups Chicago’s community areas into three distinct patterns based on standardized retail access and median income. Cluster 1 (green) captures the few neighborhoods with both above-average incomes and substantially above-average retail access-primarily concentrated downtown and along the North Side. Cluster 2 (orange) represents communities with moderately above-average incomes and retail access, generally reflecting stable, middle-income areas with established commercial corridors. Cluster 3 (blue) contains neighborhoods with below-average incomes and well-below-average retail access, spanning much of the South, Southwest, and Far Southeast Sides. Together, these clusters illustrate a clear socioeconomic gradient: communities with higher income consistently exhibit stronger per-capita access to food retailers, while lower-income areas experience systematically reduced availability."
