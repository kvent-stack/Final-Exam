    "text": "1 Overview\nThis project examined neighborhood-level disparities in food retail access across Chicago’s 77 community areas, using business license records, ACS demographics, and spatial data integration. The analysis revealed substantial variation in both the total number of food retailers and the per-capita accessibility of those retailers, with clear geographic and socioeconomic patterns. These findings highlight the extent to which food access is shaped by a combination of commercial density, residential population characteristics, and the spatial configuration of the city itself.\n\n\n2 Key Analytical Findings\nNeighborhood-Level Variation in Retail Access\nAcross Chicago, food retailer availability is highly uneven, with a small group of central-city neighborhoods dominating total store counts. The Loop, Near North Side, and Near West Side contain several hundred food retail establishments, far exceeding the citywide median of 89 stores. This reflects Chicago’s long-standing commercial clustering: mixed-use downtown areas absorb an outsized share of the region’s retail activity.\nWhen standardized by population, these disparities persist. Per-capita access ranges from 0 to nearly 55 stores per 10,000 residents, with half of all communities falling below roughly 11 stores per 10,000 residents. Central and North Side neighborhoods continue to dominate the upper tail, while many South and Southwest Side communities exhibit single-digit access levels.\nIn effect, residents in some neighborhoods have five to ten times the retail availability experienced in others.\nHigh-Access and Low-Access Neighborhood Profiles\nThe ten neighborhoods with the highest stores-per-capita values are overwhelmingly located in or adjacent to the central business district. Many combine dense concentrations of commercial property, a robust daytime population, and comparatively smaller residential bases.\nThis produces extremely high per-capita ratios even when raw store counts are moderate.\nBy contrast, the lowest-access neighborhoods are concentrated on the South Side and far Northwest Side, including areas like Oakland, Burnside, and Riverdale. These communities often pair limited commercial corridors with larger residential populations, resulting in low-access environments even when modest retail exists.\nThese disparities point to structural geographic patterns rather than isolated anomalies.\nDistributional Inequality\nDispersion measures reinforce these patterns. A standard deviation of ~10 stores per 10,000 residents - nearly equal to the median - signals substantial inequality in retail availability. The wide interquartile range and pronounced right-skew indicate that a small number of communities pull the distribution upward while many remain clustered at lower-access levels.\nCollectively, the descriptive results show that food retail in Chicago is not distributed proportionally to population and that residents experience markedly different retail environments depending on where they live.\n\n\n3 Socioeconomic Drivers of Access\nIncome as a Predictor of Retail Availability\nRegression modeling showed that median household income is significantly and positively associated with per-capita retail access. Wealthier communities tend to support more food retailers, even after controlling for population size. This suggests that retailers preferentially locate in areas with stronger consumer purchasing power, reinforcing the city’s economic geography.\nWhile the model explains roughly one-third of variation in access (Adjusted R² ≈ 0.34), the sizable residuals indicate that income alone does not capture the full set of forces that determine retail presence. Zoning, land use, historical investment, and the location of commercial corridors all likely play significant roles.\nPopulation Size and Commercial Concentration\nTotal population also shows a positive relationship with retail access, but its influence is more modest. Larger communities may sustain more businesses simply because they contain more potential customers. But the strongest concentration continues to be in areas that combine commercial density with high-income or mixed-use land patterns.\nOverall, socioeconomic conditions explain a meaningful portion of the city’s retail landscape, but not all of it.\n\n\n4 Spatial Patterns and Geographic Equity\nCore–Periphery Structure\nSpatial visualizations reveal a clear core–periphery divide:\n\nThe central city and select North Side neighborhoods show high total and per-capita access.\nLarge portions of the South, Southwest, and Far Northwest Sides fall into the lowest-access categories.\n\nThis structure mirrors long-standing patterns in both commercial development and public investment.\nImplications for Residents\nA resident in a lower-access neighborhood faces longer travel times for basic goods, fewer options for affordable and healthy food, and reduced convenience compared to residents in central corridors.\nThese burdens compound existing socioeconomic inequities and may reinforce broader disparities in health, economic mobility, and neighborhood stability.\n\n\n5 Policy Implications\nStrengthening Retail Availability in Underserved Areas\nFindings point to several potential strategies:\n\nTargeted retail incentives in communities with low per-capita access\nMixed-use zoning reforms to expand commercial corridors in underserved neighborhoods\nSupport for small grocers and culturally specific food retailers\nPublic–private partnerships aimed at increasing local food availability\n\nSuch interventions should be paired with community-led planning to ensure that investments align with resident needs.\nIntegrating Transit and Retail Planning\nBecause many low-access communities are also transit-limited, aligning CTA planning with retail investment could strengthen neighborhood resilience. Improved bus frequency, new stop placement near commercial corridors, or micro-mobility options could meaningfully increase access without major retail expansion.\nEquity Considerations\nThe concentration of retail access in wealthier and more centrally located neighborhoods raises questions about equitable distribution of commercial opportunities. Policymakers should consider food access alongside broader equity frameworks that address historical disinvestment, land-use constraints, and neighborhood-level resource gaps.\n\n\n6 Conclusions\nChicago’s food retail landscape displays striking geographic and socioeconomic disparities that shape residents’ daily access to essential goods. While high-access communities benefit from dense, mixed-use commercial environments, many South and Northwest Side neighborhoods face low per-capita availability that may impede food security and economic mobility.\nThis analysis demonstrates that both income and population contribute meaningfully to access - but do not fully explain it - suggesting that zoning, land-use history, and commercial corridor patterns also play critical roles. Ultimately, these findings underscore the need for coordinated planning efforts that prioritize retail equity as part of broader neighborhood development strategies.\n\n\n7 Future Directions\nFuture extensions of this work could include:\n\nIncorporating CTA GTFS networks to assess transit-based access\nModeling non-linear relationships using GAM or spatial regression\nIntegrating economic data from the IRS SOI or property assessments\nConducting block-group–level analysis for higher spatial precision\nAdding qualitative insights from neighborhood planning documents\n\nSuch additions would deepen the understanding of how retail access interacts with Chicago’s built environment and socioeconomic landscape."

    "text": "1 Data Acquisition\nTo build a reproducible pipeline for measuring neighborhood-level food retail access, I acquired two primary datasets through API calls: (1) Chicago’s business license dataset, which includes active food retailers, and (2) Chicago’s community area boundary file, which defines the geographic units of analysis. I also accessed tract-level population estimates from the 2022 American Community Survey (ACS) using the Census API.\n\nbiz_url =

intact, several fields contain non-critical gaps-most notably application_created_date, license_status_change_date, and ssa. These variables are administrative fields that do not affect spatial accuracy or the ability to identify active food retailers, so their missingness does not threaten the integrity of the analysis. Core fields required for this project-license status, license type, latitude/longitude coordinates, and community identifiers-are complete enough for reliable filtering and spatial joins. With 10,210 active food retail records, the dataset offers robust coverage across the city.\nNext, I standardized coordinate systems for spatial alignment and assigned each food retailer to a community area through a point-in-polygon spatial join. I then aggregated food retail counts by community and checked for representation across all 77 areas.\n\ngrocery = st_transform(grocery, st_crs(chi_comm))\n\ngrocery_joined = st_join(grocery, chi_comm, join = st_within) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(community))\n\nstore_counts = grocery_joined %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%\n  count(community, name = \"store_count\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(community = recode(community, \"OHARE\" = \"O'HARE\"))\n\nsummary(store_counts$store_count)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

These were removed prior to aggregation to avoid artificially inflating totals or creating an unintended “78th” category.\nTo finalize the analytic dataset, I merged community polygons, aggregated population totals, and food retail counts into a single spatial dataframe, then computed a standardized measure of food access: stores per 10,000 residents.\n\nchi_final = chi_comm %&gt;%\n  left_join(store_counts, by = \"community\") %&gt;%\n  left_join(comm_pop, by = \"community\") %&gt;%\n  replace_na(list(store_count = 0)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(stores_per_10k = (store_count / total_population) * 10000)\n\nsaveRDS(chi_final, \"data/chi_final.rds\")\n\nsummary(chi_final$stores_per_10k)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

The accessibility distribution ranges from 0 stores per 10,000 residents in the lowest-access community to approximately 55 per 10,000 residents in the highest, with a median around 10.6. This spread indicates substantial neighborhood variation in food retail density and confirms that the dataset is well-structured and ready for summary statistics, visualization, and regression modeling."

    "text": "Neighborhood access to food retailers is deeply uneven across Chicago, with some communities surrounded by commercial corridors and others facing low-density retail environments that limit everyday options. This project measures these disparities by combining business license data, ACS population estimates, and spatial analysis to examine how food retail access varies across the city’s 77 community areas — and how those patterns align with socioeconomic and geographic structures.\nThis site summarizes that work, providing a reproducible analysis pipeline, exploratory data visualizations, and key findings on neighborhood equity and food access."

Max. \n    0.0    43.0    79.0   130.6   159.0   691.0 \n\n\nAnalytic Interpretation: Store availability varies substantially across Chicago’s community areas, with half of neighborhoods having 89 or fewer food retailers and a small number of high-density commercial districts pulling the mean upward. The large gap between the median (89) and maximum (695) indicates a highly skewed distribution, suggesting concentrated retail clustering rather than even citywide access.\nBecause raw store counts do not account for neighborhood population differences, I examined a standardized measure of access: the number of stores per 10,000 residents.\n\nsummary(chi_final$stores_per_10k)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.

The large spread between the median (10.85) and the maximum (54.69) underscores substantial inequality in retail availability when population is taken into account.\nTo identify neighborhoods with unusually high concentrations of food retailers, I listed the ten communities with the highest number of stores per 10,000 residents.\n\nchi_final %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(stores_per_10k)) %&gt;%\n  select(community, store_count, total_population, stores_per_10k) %&gt;%\n  slice_head(n = 10)\n\nSimple feature collection with 10 features and 4 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -87.73856 ymin: 41.79529 xmax: -87.59852 ymax: 41.96163\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n         community store_count total_population stores_per_10k\n1             LOOP         604           110265       54.77713\n2  NEAR NORTH SIDE         691           149521       46.21424\n3   NEAR WEST SIDE         563           145209       38.77170\n4    ARMOUR SQUARE         134            35297       37.96357\n5        WEST TOWN         559           151361       36.93157\n6        LAKE VIEW         496           160164       30.96826\n7     LINCOLN PARK         389           128084       30.37069\n8  LOWER WEST SIDE         207            79992       25.87759\n9     LOGAN SQUARE         344           139058       24.73788\n10  ARCHER HEIGHTS          90            37106       24.25484\n                         geometry\n1  MULTIPOLYGON (((-87.60949 4...\n2  MULTIPOLYGON (((-87.62446 4...\n3  MULTIPOLYGON (((-87.63759 4...\n4  MULTIPOLYGON (((-87.62917 4...\n5  MULTIPOLYGON (((-87.65686 4...\n6  MULTIPOLYGON (((-87.64102 4...\n7  MULTIPOLYGON (((-87.63182 4...\n8  MULTIPOLYGON (((-87.63516 4...\n9  MULTIPOLYGON (((-87.68284 4...\n10 MULTIPOLYGON (((-87.71437 4...\n\n\nAnalytic Interpretation: Chicago’s highest per-capita retail access is concentrated in and around the central city, with the Loop, Near North Side, and Near West Side far outpacing all other neighborhoods. These areas combine dense commercial corridors with relatively modest residential populations, producing extremely high ratios of stores per 10,000 residents compared to the rest of the city.\nTo identify neighborhoods that may be underserved, I listed the ten communities with the lowest number of stores per 10,000 residents.\n\nchi_final %&gt;%\n  arrange(stores_per_10k) %&gt;%\n  select(community, store_count, total_population, stores_per_10k) %&gt;%\n  slice_head(n = 10)\n\nSimple feature collection with 10 features and 4 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -87.94011 ymin: 41.64458 xmax: -87.54568 ymax: 42.01896\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n         community store_count total_population stores_per_10k\n1            OHARE           0            88549      0.0000000\n2          OAKLAND           1            26032      0.3841426\n3         BURNSIDE           3            21654      1.3854253\n4        RIVERDALE           8            36151      2.2129402\n5      FOREST GLEN          42            78680      5.3380783\n6        MONTCLARE          24            41953      5.7206874\n7  MOUNT GREENWOOD          36            61502      5.8534682\n8      EDISON PARK          32            52337      6.1142213\n9  CALUMET HEIGHTS          28            44391      6.3075849\n10        CLEARING          54            81856      6.5969507\n                         geometry\n1  MULTIPOLYGON (((-87.83658 4...\n2  MULTIPOLYGON (((-87.59215 4...\n3  MULTIPOLYGON (((-87.58737 4...\n4  MULTIPOLYGON (((-87.60157 4...\n5  MULTIPOLYGON (((-87.76919 4...\n6  MULTIPOLYGON (((-87.78942 4...\n7  MULTIPOLYGON (((-87.69646 4...\n8  MULTIPOLYGON (((-87.80676 4...\n9  MULTIPOLYGON (((-87.54568 4...\n10 MULTIPOLYGON (((-87.73762 4...\n\n\nAnalytic Interpretation: The neighborhoods with the lowest per-capita retail access are primarily located on the South and far Northwest sides, with several areas-such as Oakland, Burnside, and Riverdale-showing extremely limited availability relative to their population size. These values, many under 7 stores per 10,000 residents, highlight substantial geographic inequities in Chicago’s retail landscape and point to potential gaps in neighborhood-serving commercial infrastructure.\nTo assess how unevenly food retail access is distributed across Chicago, I calculated simple dispersion measures (variance, standard deviation, and IQR) for stores per 10,000 residents.\n\nc(\n  variance = var(chi_final$stores_per_10k, na.rm = TRUE),\n  sd       = sd(chi_final$stores_per_10k, na.rm = TRUE),\n  iqr      = IQR(chi_final$stores_per_10k, na.rm = TRUE)\n)\n\n variance        sd       iqr \n102.06746  10.10284  10.91589 \n\n\nAnalytic Interpretation: Retail access shows substantial dispersion across Chicago’s neighborhoods, with a standard deviation of roughly 10 stores per 10,000 residents-nearly as large as the median itself. The high variance and wide interquartile range (IQR ≈ 10.9) reinforce that retail access is unevenly distributed, with significant gaps between the least- and best-served communities.\nTo evaluate whether socioeconomic conditions help explain disparities in per-capita retail access, I incorporated median household income from the 2022 ACS, aggregated it to community areas, merged it into the analytical dataset, and estimated a linear regression predicting stores per 10,000 residents from income and population size.\n\nlibrary(tigris)\noptions(tigris_use_cache = TRUE)\n\ntracts_cc = tracts(state = \"IL\", county = \"Cook\", year = 2022, cb = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  st_as_sf() %&gt;%\n  clean_names()\n\nacs_income = get_acs(\n  geography = \"tract\",\n  variables = \"B19013_001\",\n  state = \"IL\",\n  county = \"Cook\",\n  year = 2022,\n  geometry = FALSE\n) %&gt;%\n  clean_names() %&gt;%\n  transmute(geoid, median_income = estimate)\n\ntracts_income = tracts_cc %&gt;%\n  left_join(acs_income, by = \"geoid\")\n\ncommunity_geom = chi_final %&gt;%\n  select(community, geometry) %&gt;%\n  mutate(community = toupper(community))\n\ntracts_income = st_transform(tracts_income, st_crs(community_geom))\n\ntract_income_join = st_intersection(tracts_income, community_geom)\n\ncomm_income = tract_income_join %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%\n  group_by(community) %&gt;%\n  summarise(median_income = mean(median_income, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nchi_final = chi_final %&gt;%\n  mutate(community = toupper(community)) %&gt;%\n  left_join(comm_income, by = \"community\")\n\nchi_final = chi_final %&gt;%\n  mutate(median_income = median_income) %&gt;%\n  select(-matches(\"median_income\\\\.x|median_income\\\\.y\"))\n\nmodel = lm(stores_per_10k ~ median_income + total_population, data = chi_final)\nsummary(model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = stores_per_10k ~ median_income + total_population, \n    data = chi_final)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-16.9230  -4.8953  -0.6614   3.2486  28.6762 \n\nCoefficients:\n                   Estimate Std.

Holding population constant, each additional $10,000 in median income is associated with roughly 1.36 additional stores per 10,000 residents, suggesting that commercial investment disproportionately gravitates toward wealthier neighborhoods. Total population also shows a positive relationship: larger communities tend to support slightly higher densities of food retailers even after the per-capita adjustment, likely reflecting the combined effects of foot traffic, customer base diversity, and business viability. The model explains about 33% of the variation in retail access (Adjusted R² = 0.315), indicating that socioeconomic conditions meaningfully-though not exclusively-structure the distribution of food retailers across the city. The sizable residual variance suggests that additional factors such as zoning, transit access, commercial corridors, or historical patterns of investment likely contribute to the remaining disparities.\nTo assess whether the linear model meets key assumptions, I generated standard diagnostic plots, including residuals vs. fitted values, a Q–Q plot, and leverage checks.\n\npar(mfrow = c(2,2))\nplot(model)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npar(mfrow = c(1,1))\n\nAnalytic Interpretation: The diagnostic plots suggest that the linear model performs reasonably well but exhibits a few modest assumption violations. The residuals-vs-fitted and scale-location plots show mild curvature and some heteroskedasticity, indicating that the relationship between predictors and per-capita access may not be perfectly linear across the entire range of values. The Q–Q plot shows slight right-tail deviation, driven by a few high-access communities that behave as mild outliers. Finally, the leverage plot identifies a small number of influential observations, but none appear to exert disproportionate influence on the model’s coefficients. Overall, the model is sufficiently stable for exploratory analysis, though future refinements could incorporate nonlinear terms or robust estimation.\n\n\n2 Data Visualizations\nThis plot illustrates how food retailer counts vary across Chicago’s 77 community areas.\n\nggplot(chi_final, aes(x = store_count)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = \"#2C7FB8\", color = \"white\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title=\"Distribution of Store Counts\", x=\"Store Count\", y=\"Communities\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalytic Interpretation: The distribution of store counts is heavily right-skewed, with most communities supporting between 40 and 150 food retailers while a handful of central neighborhoods contain several hundred. This pattern reflects Chicago’s commercial clustering, where downtown and adjacent areas absorb a disproportionate share of the city’s total retail activity.\nThis plot shows the distribution of stores per 10,000 residents, highlighting how standardized access differs across neighborhoods.\n\nggplot(chi_final, aes(x = stores_per_10k)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = \"#41B6C4\", color=\"white\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title=\"Distribution of Stores per 10k Residents\",\n       x=\"Stores per 10k\", y=\"Communities\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalytic Interpretation: Standardizing by population reveals a similarly skewed pattern, with most communities falling between 8 and 20 stores per 10,000 residents and a small group far exceeding that range. The extended right tail highlights how a limited number of high-density, mixed-use neighborhoods drive much higher per-capita retail availability compared to the citywide norm.\nThis map displays the geographic distribution of total food retailer counts across Chicago.\n\nggplot(chi_final) +\n  geom_sf(aes(fill = store_count), color=\"white\", size=0.2) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c() +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalytic Interpretation: Total retailer counts are highest in the central city-particularly the Loop, Near North Side, Near West Side, and surrounding areas-where commercial density is strongest. Outlying neighborhoods show far lower store totals, underscoring an uneven distribution of commercial investment and business activity across Chicago.\nThis map highlights disparities in standardized retail access by showing stores per 10,000 residents.\n\nggplot(chi_final) +\n  geom_sf(aes(fill = stores_per_10k), color=\"white\", size=0.2) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(option=\"magma\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalytic Interpretation: When adjusted for population, per-capita access remains concentrated in the city’s core and along select North Side corridors, while large portions of the South and Southwest Sides exhibit noticeably lower access. This pattern suggests that both commercial density and residential composition jointly shape neighborhood-level availability of food retailers, amplifying geographic disparities in access.\nTo complement the static visualizations, I created an interactive map that allows users to explore individual retailer locations and their distribution across Chicago.\n\ngrocery = st_read(\"https://data.cityofchicago.org/resource/xqx5-8hwx.geojson?$limit=50000\")\n\nReading layer `OGRGeoJSON' from data source \n  `https://data.cityofchicago.org/resource/xqx5-8hwx.geojson?$limit=50000' \n  using driver `GeoJSON'\nreplacing null geometries with empty geometries\nSimple feature collection with 50000 features and 40 fields (with 4644 geometries empty)\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -87.9069 ymin: 41.64467 xmax: -87.5248 ymax: 42.02266\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n\ngrocery_map = grocery %&gt;%\n  st_transform(st_crs(chi_final)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    lon = st_coordinates(geometry)[,1],\n    lat = st_coordinates(geometry)[,2]\n  )\n\nleaflet(grocery_map) %&gt;%\n  addTiles() %&gt;%\n  addCircleMarkers(\n    lng = ~lon, lat = ~lat,\n    radius = 2, stroke = FALSE, fillOpacity = 0.6\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nK-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning method that groups observations into distinct clusters based on their similarity. Here, I use it to identify whether Chicago’s community areas naturally sort into meaningful categories based on per-capita retail access and median household income, revealing whether structural patterns exist beyond simple linear relationships.\n\ncluster_data = chi_final %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%\n  select(community, stores_per_10k, median_income) %&gt;%\n  drop_na()\n\ncluster_scaled = cluster_data %&gt;%\n  select(stores_per_10k, median_income) %&gt;%\n  scale()\n\nset.seed(123)\nk3 = kmeans(cluster_scaled, centers = 3, nstart = 25)\n\ncluster_data$cluster = factor(k3$cluster)\n\nchi_final = chi_final %&gt;%\n  left_join(cluster_data %&gt;% select(community, cluster), by = \"community\")\n\nggplot(chi_final) +\n  geom_sf(aes(fill = cluster), color = \"white\", size = 0.2) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Clusters of Chicago Communities by Retail Access & Income\",\n    fill = \"Cluster\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nk3$centers\n\n  stores_per_10k median_income\n1      2.0913137     1.7721685\n2     -0.1319613     0.3507877\n3     -0.4303994    -0.8553662\n\n\nAnalytic Interpretation: The k-means clustering algorithm separates Chicago’s community areas into three clear groups based on retail access and neighborhood income. Cluster 1 (green) captures a small set of high-income, high-access neighborhoods concentrated downtown and on the North Side, where dense commercial corridors and strong consumer demand reinforce one another. Cluster 2 (orange) includes most South and Southwest Side communities and reflects the lowest retail access and lowest incomes, highlighting areas where structural disinvestment constrains residents’ options. Cluster 3 (blue) represents moderate-income, moderate-access neighborhoods that sit between these extremes and are largely distributed across the North and Northwest Sides. Together, the clusters show that retail access aligns closely with Chicago’s socioeconomic geography, revealing patterned inequities rather than random variation."
